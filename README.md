# Channel Modelling
MATLAB Simulation for various channel fading with different modulation


# Example 1
For Rayleigh Fading Channel using Jake’s fading simulator

Results plotted for different samples and different symbol durations for time sampling 

# Example 2 
MIMO System 2*1 ; 2 Transmitter and 1 Receiver with two sets of ST Signals with 2*2 configuration sending at 2-time slots
